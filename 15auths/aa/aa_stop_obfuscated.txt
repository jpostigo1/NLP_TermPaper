After telling grandfather great inspiration received engineering stories NASA, advised must always best school earn good grades order find exemplary engineering job. He always made sure tell follow footsteps aeronautical engineering, pursue whatever career interested. intend go career mechanical engineering. hope improve automotive safety advances safety research. know would like pursue career automotive safety last year followed researcher developed new seat belts. fascinated processes researcher employed create new designs. As pencil first touched blueprint began design process, drew breath saw innovations transpiring page. He furiously drew ingenious new seat belt design mimics full safety benefits five-point safety harness, maintaining comfort ease-of-use traditional three-point seat belt found consumer automobiles. While "basic" number crunching paper, entered data blueprints computer rendered full computer model mere minutes.
