American schools US standardized exams, yet exams rarely impede student determine future extent exams foreign countries. Immigrants Americans Japanese descent brought US programs Kumon Juku schools popular teaching standardized testing skills ways similar schools Japan modeled. There extreme need cram schools Kumon teach specific information needed pass exams. Kumon founded Japan father means son problems school math skills. This method teaching speed accuracy math reading available worldwide 40 countries located popular open educational system nationality person. Kumon students expected complete work pace advance next level placed appropriate score range standard accuracy speed comparison previously computed expectation. The mathematics curriculum ranges easy level counting advanced math, algebra, advanced algebra, geometry, trigonometry, difficult level statistics total 27 math levels. (In cases students may assignments calculus physics). The 7 reading levels consist reading, phonics, vocabulary building, grammar, punctuation, reading comprehension. The goal Kumon according author Ukai eventually lead students ability solve differential equations calculus school work. And introduced even possibility students young elementary school age also able solve calculus problem introduced small increasingly difficult steps daily. Many elementary, junior high later high school math textbooks require student learns nearly new subject day. And new day’s subject generally linked previous lesson, nearly consideration student’s ability answer previous day’s questions increasing accuracy, personalized level understanding materials. Such method many American schools used many generations. There many people express dislike math. Some students may obtain low scores. But possible classes designed similar Kumon class, would many students left behind. There flaw teaching new skill every day student understand previous day’s skill understand newly introduced complex lesson following day. One main issue learning math level based personal skills get behind still responsible homework exams may make sense time.
