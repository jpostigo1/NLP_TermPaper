The trial of Burr for treason occurred in Richmond, Virginia, a “sleepy little town [ that ] became the cynosure of all eyes.” The courtroom could not hold the crowds, forcing Marshall to move the trial to the House of Delegates, a larger space. among those in town were Andrew Jackson, a young Washington Irving as a journalist. Winfield Scott. The first opinion issued by Marshall concerned precisely with what charge. charges should Burr be held accountable. detained before a grand jury heard the case for indictment. One aspect of this was a potentially damaging letter produced through Wilkinson. was not the original copy. Though Marshall stipulated that the evidence needed to commit Burr did not have to be as stringent as that which might produce an indictment. conviction, he discussed at length the problems surrounding the authenticity. accuracy of the letter before committing Burr for violation of the Neutrality Act. “setting on foot. providing the means for an expedition against the territories of a nation at peace with the U.S., ”. not for treason. This small victory for Burr was compounded by a statement by Marshall that seemed directed at Jefferson in particular, that “the hand of malignity may [ not ] grasp any individual against whom its hate may be directed. whom it may capriciously seize, charge him with some secret crime. put him on the proof of his innocence.” This, though forcefully worded, elicits Marshall’s underlying principal that the prosecution, particularly Jefferson, was running roughshod over individual rights. acting counter to the spirit. text of law. It also marks the beginning of Marshall’s consistent judgments that the charges must be proven in the context of the law, not merely in public perception. After striking this blow against Jefferson, Marshall committed what might be seen as an ethical blunder. Invited to a dinner by John Wickham, a lawyer on Burr’s counsel, Marshall arrived, stayed. dined although Aaron Burr himself was also in attendance. The press discovered this. publicized it. the trial that “was already political…became hopelessly so. Everything Marshall did from now on would be under a cloud.” Though still before a grand jury even indicted Burr, passions on all sides were roused. A letter from Burr to his daughter, Theodosia, describes. the general atmosphere as well as one early point of contention in the trial, the makeup. prejudice of the grand jury: The grand jury is composed of twenty democrats. four federalists. Among the former is W.C. Nicholas, my vindictive. avowed enemy- the most so that could be found in this state (Virginia). The most indefatigable industry is used by the agents of government. they have money at command without stint. If I were possessed of the same means, I could not only foil the prosecutors. render them ridiculous. infamous. The democratic papers teem with abuse against me. my counsel. even against the chief justice.
