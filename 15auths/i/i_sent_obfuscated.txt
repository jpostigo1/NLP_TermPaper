I also fulfill religious, political. gender roles. These values are important to me; I believe that my ultimate goal to become a social worker incorporates these values as well. In relation to my roles. responsibilities in a family setting, I pride myself on all these values. As a daughter, I hold respect for my parents. as a sister, I value my individuality. Because I am a twin, it has been hard to separate myself from my sister. As a child, it was a competition to see who succeeded at what subjects. who performed the best. As adults, it is no longer a competition. I value my individuality. my ability to separate myself from her, even if I do sometimes compare myself to her. As a fiance, I value the equality in my relationship, my individuality as a person with unique ideas. beliefs, open-mindedness to explore my fiance’s perspective. respect for him as an individual. As a student, I value equality, individuality, open-mindedness. respect for others. Equality is important because even though we, as students, are all individuals, we need to see each other as equals. not make judgements of others. Individuality is important because we do not want our sole description of ourselves to be that of a student; we are so much more. Being open-minded is important so that we can listen to each other’s different perspectives. not be judgmental. Finally, these different values lead to respect for others. We can not be equal. open-minded if we do not respect the individual. As an intern. a possible role-model, I value equality, individuality, open-mindedness. respect for others. My internship is with Success for All Students, a program that is a part of the Cobb County School District. My main role. responsibility is to gather screening information to possibly provide interventions to students if necessary. It is necessary to see the students as equals. as individuals, not as just “cases” to be examined. I must also maintain an open-minded perspective while performing my job responsibilities. Above all else, I must respect the family. student. not jump to conclusions based upon the screenings I perform. As an intern, I may also find myself as a possible role-model to the students during possible interactions with them. As for political, religious. gender roles, it is important to express my four chosen values. Politically. religiously, I recognize that my perspective is not the only one, which means I must value open-mindedness. respect for others. As a female, I realize I must always fight the stereotypical “women should be in the kitchen” viewpoint. Granted, this stereotype is rarely referred to anymore. it still circulates. thus, my four values come into play: equality for both genders, individuality to express that every woman is different, open-mindedness. respect in order to realize that not all woman mind that stereotype.
